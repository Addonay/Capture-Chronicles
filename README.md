# Capture-Chronicles
## Project Description
Capture Chronicles is a photography portfolio and sharing website. The website showcases stunning imagery captured by skilled photographers, with a focus on telling stories through photos.
The website has a simple navigation with buttons for Home, About, Gallery, and Contact. When a button is clicked, the corresponding content is displayed in the main content section.
The Home page introduces the website and its mission to celebrate the beauty of life through photography. The About page provides details about the website and features testimonials from happy customers.
The core of the website is the Gallery, which displays high-quality photos from the photographers' portfolio. The photos are stored in a db.json file, which contains the URLs and IDs of each image. When the Gallery button is clicked, JavaScript code fetches the data from the db.json file and dynamically displays the images on the page.
The Contact page allows visitors to get in touch with a contact form and social media links. Visitors can request more information, book a photographer, or leave feedback.
The website utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript to achieve its functionality. Key features include:
Dynamically fetching data from a JSON file and displaying images
Showing different content based on navigation button clicks
A clean, minimal design that lets the photos take center stage
The goal of Capture Chronicles is to inspire and captivate visitors with stunning photography that captures the essence of every moment. The website aims to showcase the photographers' unique style and ability to tell visual stories through their photos.
